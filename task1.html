                    semi-permanent residence for an individual, group or family. It is a fully
                    or semi sheltered space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it.
                    Homes provide sheltered spaces for instance rooms, where domestic activity
                    can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well
                    as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying
                    and playing.</p>
